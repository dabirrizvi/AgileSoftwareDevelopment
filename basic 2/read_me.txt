When add new recipe button is pressed the old add recipe page is not enough because we have other factors such as costed shopping list ,ingredients, allergens etc to put in the page and having only one place to write the recipe details will not be correct so what I want you to do is when we press add new recipe button I want to have an editable text format of single-recipe.html format type page and each part should be editable in a text format and each headings should be called separately so that we can make changes on each headings separately and connect each heading to respective database.
